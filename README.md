# mysql_colyseum_exercice

Welcome to my repository, I am a junior web developer in training at Be/Code and I am currently learning about mysql. This repository will contain all my exercises about this matter and will be updated according to my exploration of the database and languages. It will include CRUD requests and more informations about updates will be provided in the following days. This repository was first started on January 20th 2023. 

## Who Am I

I'm a junior developer trying to get a good grip on php with projects and other things. I am currently in training at BeCode and do this as part of my training.

## How to use it ?

To use the forms, you will need a local server or a distant server. You can use the ```.env.example``` file to find the structure of the informations required to allow the form to work properly. You can either remove the .example part of create a new file named ```.env.``` It contains three fields :

    a server name
    a username
    a password
    a database name

These informations will be used when creating the connection to the database for the CRUD operations.
